            <h1>The story of Lonnie Builds Things!</h1>
            <h3>A story of how one man seized his piece of the American Dream.</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Hello, my name is Lonnie, and I look forward to working with you to make your custom project dreams come true!</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I am Indiana born and raised, and my career started like so many others. I worked factory jobs in all areas, including
            management and upper management. I was working a factory job when Corona hit. Overnight my factory went from 96
            employees to 12. I was one of the ones to be let go.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>A few months into lockdown, while everyone was watching the world come to a pause, a family friend sent me a picture on
            Facebook. It was a wood burnt flag, and she wanted to know if I could make her one.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I figured out what materials I would need, and I bought the materials for 5.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>My mother and father are telling people that I'm making wood burnt flags now. All five were gone before I completed
            them. So, I made eight more. Then, I made 15 more.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>At this moment, my mother suggested I try the Shipshewana flea market in Shipshewana, Indiana. She's a big fan of the
            Amish, so I assumed she just wanted to spend time with them for the day.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I took 50 pieces of inventory with me.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I came home with 6.</p>
            <br />
            <p>It was at that moment I felt like I was on to something. I was right. Becoming my own boss and owning my own business
            has been the best thing to ever happen to me. I can spend time with family and friends making these flags, and I have
            appreciated every memory we have made doing so.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I donate numerous pieces to foundations and fundraisers each year.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I set up at multiple fairs, festivals, and flea markets throughout the year.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I always look forward to meeting and having conversations with people.</p>
